# Translator: MiniC to ASM i8080

This repository contains:
- Lexical Analyzer.
(To provide Tokens of my input code)

- Top-Down Syntax Analyzer.
(To check if code correct or not and translate it to Atom language and then to ASM i8080)

- Shunting Yard Machine.
(Just for fun. And because my teacher asked me to)

## How to Use

Just clone it.
After that you can input your code in:
- MiniC_Code.minic
and there will be 3 different output files.
1. CodeGraph.graph - that will draw you a tree of disassembly
2. Atoms.atom - that will give you your code on Atoms language
3. Result.asm - that will give you your code on ASM i8080
