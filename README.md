# Lexical Analyzer

This repository contains a lexical analyzer, which is a key component of the compilation process. 
The analyzer takes a source code file as input and produces a sequence of tokens, which are the smallest meaningful units of the program.

## How to Use

To use the lexical analyzer, clone this repository and run the analyzer with the source code file as an argument.

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/RezyIGL/LexerTvSU>
cd LexerTvSU
```

Then build this project with CMake.
The output will be a list of tokens, each of which will be displayed on its own line.
